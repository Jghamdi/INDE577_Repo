## Purpose
The primary objective of this repository is to demonstrate proficiency in both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Through theoretical explanations and practical implementations, we aim to illustrate the significance of these methodologies in solving real-world problems and extracting valuable insights from data.

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is about making computers modify or adapt their actions so that these actions get more accurate, where accuracy is measured by how well the chosen actions reflect the correct one. In recent years, machine learning has seen an explosion of interest from both academia and industry, though it should be noted that the concept of machine learning has been around since the 1950s. The goal of machine learning is to use data to make predictions on unseen data.

## The Components of Machine Learning
In both supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks, the classification and regression labels of the data are given by some unknown target function called f. In order for a problem to fall into the realm of machine learning, we can never know the true value of f.

- ### Supervised Machine Learning
In supervised learning, we know at least some of the inputs of the target function as well as some of the associated labels given by the target function.

- ### Unsupervised Machine Learning
In unsupervised learning, we know at least some of the inputs of the target function as well as none of the associated labels given by the target function.
