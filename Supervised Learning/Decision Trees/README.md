# Decision Trees
The Decision Trees Algorithm is a versatile and interpretable method used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by recursively partitioning the feature space into subsets, based on the values of the input features, and making predictions at the leaf nodes of the tree.

## Overview
Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm that learns a series of if-else decision rules from the data. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on the value of a specific feature, and each leaf node represents a class label or a continuous value.

Decision trees are known for their simplicity, interpretability, and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data. They are particularly useful when the data contains non-linear relationships or interactions between features.

### Parameters

- **Split Criterion**: The criterion used to measure the quality of a split, such as Gini impurity or information gain.  
- **Maximum Depth**: The maximum depth of the tree. Limiting the depth helps prevent overfitting.
- **Minimum Samples Split**: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
- **Minimum Samples Leaf**: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.  

### Applications  
- **Classification**: Predicting customer churn, identifying fraudulent transactions.
- **Regression**: Predicting house prices, estimating sales revenue.  
 
### Getting Started  
To use the Decision Trees algorithm:  

1. Prepare your dataset and split it into training and testing sets.  
2. Choose appropriate hyperparameters for the decision tree model.  
3. Train the model using the training data.  
4. Make predictions on the test data.  
5. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy or mean squared error.
