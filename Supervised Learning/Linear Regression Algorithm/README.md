# Linear Regression Algorithm

The Linear Regression Algorithm is a fundamental technique in the field of statistical modeling and machine learning. It is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Overview

In its simplest form, linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. The algorithm aims to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.

Linear regression is commonly used for tasks such as predicting house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms, forecasting sales based on advertising expenditure, and analyzing the relationship between variables in scientific research.

Despite its simplicity, linear regression remains a powerful tool in the data scientist's toolkit due to its interpretability, ease of implementation, and ability to provide insights into the relationships between variables.

In this repository, we provide a simple implementation of the linear regression algorithm in Python, along with a sample dataset (Palmer Penguins) for training and testing purposes.
