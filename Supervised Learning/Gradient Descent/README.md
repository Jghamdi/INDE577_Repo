# Gradient Descent Algorithm

The Gradient Descent Algorithm is a fundamental optimization technique used in machine learning and optimization problems. It is employed to minimize the cost or loss function by iteratively updating the parameters of a model in the direction of the steepest descent of the gradient.

## Overview

In machine learning, gradient descent is commonly used to train models by adjusting the weights or coefficients to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual targets. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the cost function is non-convex or not analytically solvable.

The basic idea behind gradient descent is to compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters and update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. By iteratively repeating this process, the algorithm converges to the optimal set of parameters that minimize the cost function.

There are several variants of gradient descent, including:

- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Computes the gradient using the entire training dataset.  

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Computes the gradient using a single random sample from the training dataset.  

- **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: Computes the gradient using a small random subset of the training dataset.  

Gradient descent is a crucial optimization algorithm used in training various machine learning models, including linear   regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and deep learning models.  

In this repository, we provide a simple implementation of the gradient descent algorithm in Python, along with examples demonstrating its usage in optimizing a cost function.
