# Logistic Regression Algorithm

The Logistic Regression Algorithm is a commonly used statistical method for binary classification tasks. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm. It is particularly well-suited for problems where the dependent variable is categorical and has two possible outcomes.

## Overview  

Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous numeric values, logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input instance belongs to a particular class. It models the probability of the dependent variable as a function of the independent variables using a logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function.

Logistic regression is widely used in various fields, including healthcare (e.g., predicting the likelihood of disease based on patient characteristics), marketing (e.g., predicting the likelihood of a customer buying a product), and finance (e.g., predicting whether a loan applicant will default).

One of the key advantages of logistic regression is its simplicity and interpretability. The coefficients learned by the algorithm can provide insights into the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the outcome.

In this repository, we provide a simple implementation of the logistic regression algorithm in Python, along with a sample dataset (Palmer Penguins) for training and testing purposes.
