# Neural Networks
Neural Networks are powerful computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons (also called nodes or units) that process information and learn patterns from data.

## Overview
Neural networks are capable of learning complex relationships and patterns in data through a process called training. During training, the network adjusts its parameters (weights and biases) using optimization algorithms like gradient descent to minimize a predefined loss function.

The basic building block of a neural network is the artificial neuron, which takes inputs, applies weights, and produces an output through an activation function. Multiple neurons are organized into layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer except the input layer typically has a bias unit and is fully connected to the neurons in the adjacent layers.

There are various types of neural networks, including:  

- **Feedforward Neural Networks**: Information flows in one direction, from input to output, without cycles or loops.    

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Designed for processing structured grid data such as images, with specialized layers for feature extraction and spatial hierarchies.  
 
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Suitable for processing sequences of data, with feedback connections that allow information to persist over time.  

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**: A variant of RNNs designed to better capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.  

Neural networks have shown remarkable success in various domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.  

In this repository, we provide implementations of neural networks using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, along with examples demonstrating their usage for various tasks.
